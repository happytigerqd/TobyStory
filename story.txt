Hello, I'm Xiaxin Li(Toby). I'm a junior studying mathematics. In my spare
time, I love to play various sports, especially tennis. 

I also enjoy to write programs, and my favorite professor is Andy.
Andy is the absolute best professor that has ever lived. I cannot express
my love for Andy's teaching style enough.

I play tennis. I go skiing every other week. I hope one day I could have the honor to ski with Andy.

Or maybe I can beat Andy and become CS professor! Haha

No one knows what's happenning in the future anyway.
